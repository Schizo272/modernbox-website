            <strong>ModernBox "wtf" update 1.9.8</strong><br>
            <em>Overhaul - Changed all the weapons from "steel" to "wood" (even MIRVs), this is temporary until I find a better solution.</em><br>
            <em>Adjustment - Tanks are now at 5K health</em><br>
            <em>Bugfix - MIRV boats are almost fixed, tho I'm keeping the sprites as the old ones still so they won't appear as fixed yet.</em><br>
            <em>Overhaul - Tanks aren't MIRV like anymore.</em><br>
            <em>Addition - Other things</em>

            <em>Addition - Added a few more buttons to the tab for settings.</em><br>
            <em>Adjustment - Changed the weapon on the tank from "Mp5" to "RocketLauncher". I have no clue why it was set to "Mp5"</em>

            <em>Bugfix - Fixed Index Array error that caused the games buildings to randomly freeze the game.</em><br>
            <em>Bugfix - Fixed that the "turn off pipe guns" option didn't actually turn off pipe guns.</em><br>
            <em>Addition - Tanks and Helicopters can now be spawned whenever you want, instead of the previous restrictions such as docks.</em><br>
            <em>Overhaul - All guns now use the "steel" material instead of "base", this could potentially solve some issues.</em><br>
            <em>Refactor - I have refactored a lot of debug logs.</em><br>
            <em>Feature - The Debug logger will now display the file path at the top.</em><br>
